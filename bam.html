          <h1>BAM</h1>
          <center>
            <p>
              In January of 2021, I was elected the Director of Technology for
              BAM (Business Association of Multicultural Students).
            </p>
            <img src="images/bam/bam-board.jpeg" style="width: 60%" />
            <p>During my term, here's some of the things I did:</p>
          </center>
          <h2>The Website</h2>
          <center>
            <h4>Before</h4>
            <img src="images/bam/home.png" alt="" style="width: 70%" />

            <br /><br />
            <h4>After</h4>
            <br />
            <img src="images/bam/homeAfter2021.png" alt="" style="width: 70%" />
            <br /><img src="images/bam/join2.png" alt="" style="width: 70%" />
          </center>
          <p>
            After getting feedback from BAM members, I was told that the large
            background picture made the text too difficult to see. Also, only
            having the board member's in the photo made some very dedicated
            members feel left out. The muted blue did not seem to match the
            liveliness of BAM's events. To resolve this, I updated the color
            palette and created some simple backgrounds that used those colors,
            and created a gallary carousel.
          </p>
          <h2>Digital Resume System</h2>
          <center>
            <img
              src="images/bam/bam-resume-portal.png"
              alt="resume portal picture"
              style="width: 70%"
            />
            <p>
              Previously, each semester the BAM board would collect pdf's of
              each members resume and compile them into one giant pdf to be sent
              to our sponsors. This was a very tedious task that would take the
              board about a week to complete. Also, the issue of having out of
              date resumes I wrote a Google App Scripts to automate the resume
              collection process. The script would place the students resume in
              the appropriate section and rename each resume with the student's
              name and the date (ex. LynhTran_Fall21.pdf). The Sponsors would
              have access to these resumes as they are sent in during the
              semester on their own private portal, with the password to access
              changing every month. The sponsor view would have folders
              representing each semester with the respective resumes in each.
            </p>
          </center>
          <h2>Alumni Database & Attendence Tracking</h2>
          <p>
            Having a database of past BAM members could be very beneficial for
            finding speakers, sponsors, and job opprotunities for future BAM
            members. This is why we decided to create an alumni database. This
            was a 3 month process of attempting to reach out to members of the
            last 10 years using the little information we could find from the
            university and past records. The lack of resources also demonstrated
            we needed a more organized way of tracking attendance to our events.
            We created a new system where before entering each event, there
            would be a QR code to sign in. I then created a Google App Script
            that would compile all the sign in entries and automatically update
            charts and tables for board members to see. This helped us recognize
            what events were successful, what students we were attracting, and
            which marketing strategies were most sucessful.
