# :pencil: Portfolio

Hi I'm Lynh and I'm currently in the process of making a portfolio website. You can check out what I've got so far by clicking link in my about section!

I am currently converting this to use React and tailwindcss (see [react-version](https://github.com/LynhTran/LynhTran.github.io/tree/react-version)  branch for progress).
